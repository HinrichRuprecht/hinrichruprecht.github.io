<h4>Data import</h4>
This family tree page uses ancestral data in the <a href="https://wiki.genealogy.net/GEDCOM">GEDCOM</a> format, which is generated (exported) by appropriate programs (e.g. <a href="https://gramps-project.org/">GRAMPS</a>).
<br>You must first select a GEDCOM file, either by clicking the file selector in the top left corner of the page or by appending ?f=FILENAME to the link (the file must then be located in the same directory as this website).
<br>For testing, you can select ?f=Dynasties, a not entirely up-to-date database of European aristocracy. Due to the large amount of data, some patience is required.
<br>
<h4>Select and display</h4>
Using the search field (for parts of the name), the initial letter of the surname, or the list of surnames, a person can be selected, for which all available information, including partners, children, parents, and siblings, will be displayed.
<br>In addition, the lower section can optionally display the ancestors and descendants, or only the ancestors. In the former view, the position of the selected person in the display can be moved left or right by clicking '<' or '>'. '+/-Generation' displays more or fewer generations of ancestors or descendants.
<br>Clicking on 'Date' displays the birth and death dates of the people, if available.
<br>Clicking on a person makes it the selected person, and all available information about it is displayed.
<br>A &#9665; as the last character in the frame indicates that there are other people connected to the person. Clicking on this character will no longer include these people. Clicking on &#9654; will undo this.
<br>
Objects assigned to a person as a file must be located in the obj/ subdirectory of the server directory of this website.
<br>
<h4>Print</h4>
When you click 'Print,' you'll be asked whether you want to print only the family tree at the bottom. 'Background images' should be checked in the print options.
<br>
<h4>Data export</h4>
Clicking 'Export' will save the data of all ancestors and descendants, including siblings and partners, of the selected person to a file of your choice.
<br>If another person is selected and exported again, the previously exported data will be added. People "after" &#9654; (see above) will not be exported.
<br>
<h4>Browser</h4>
This website has been tested with the latest Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Edge. On smartphones, the data at the bottom often doesn't fit into the small frames.
<br>
<h4>Further Information</h4>
The website also includes
<br>&nbsp;Help pages: <i>Language</i>-help.html (e.g., de-help.html)
<br>&nbsp;Translation files: <i>Language</i>-trans.txt (e.g., de-trans.txt)
<br>&nbsp;Pedigree.conf: a "GEDCOM attribute" file that translates GEDCOM terms into English and also controls what is displayed.
<br>These files, if available, are loaded from the same directory as this website. You can also select your own locally stored files using the file selection (top left) before loading the actual GEDCOM file. The files are assigned according to their extension:
<br>&nbsp;-help.html (help text, HTML formatted),
<br>&nbsp;-trans.txt (translations, <i>English COMMA translation)</i>,
<br>&nbsp;.conf (attribute file, see below),
<br>&nbsp;.ged (GEDCOM data)
<br>Multiple GEDCOM files can, in principle, be loaded in parallel.
Result??
<br><br>If no file is found for the language set in the browser,
English names will be used. The same applies if no translation is found for individual terms.
<br>The control file for the GEDCOM attributes to be displayed (Pedigree.conf)
can be adapted to your own needs if necessary.
This also applies to the translation file:
<br>When called with the ?ATT parameter, all attributes of the previous attribute file plus additional attributes of the current data are displayed in the help section.

<br>Calling with ?TRA displays the translations. (If necessary, also 
?ATT&amp;TRA)
<br>Example line (ATT): <pre>INDI.BIRT.DATE Birth date</pre>
(Format: <i>tag.tag... TAB English term)</i><br>
In addition, data without English terms is now also displayed.
<br>If changes are desired, the section can be copied
and transferred to a new file. This can also be loaded without access to the server directory (see above).
