<h4>Select and display</h4>
With the help of the search field (for any information about people), the
first letter of the family name or the list of family names, a
person will be selected, including all available information about the 
spouses, children, parents and siblings are shown.
<br>In addition, either the ancestors or ancestors and descendants 
are shown at the bottom. In the latter representation, the
position of the selected person in the presentation can be moved 
by clicking '<' or '>', so that more or less ancestor
or progeny generations are displayed. By clicking on '+ / - Date'
the birth and death dates of the persons are shown, if available.
<br>Clicking on a person sets it as the selected person, and all available 
information on this person is displayed.
<br>
<h4>Note on data changes</h4>
All data that is changed or added is at first only stored locally in
the browser (e.g. Firefox or Internet Explorer), more precisely in so
called cookies. These cookies may be deleted, when closing the
browser depending on browser setting. For a permanent transfer into the database
the changes must be sent to someone who puts the changed data into the
family database. Click on 'Mail' to send. See also export data.
<br>
<h4>Data changes</h4>
By clicking on 'Edit Person' all possible information fields are
displayed, and new or changed data for the selected person can be 
entered. In addition, spouses or children can be assigned. 
<br>To do so, for a spouse first behind '+ spouse' and then
select the spouse.
<br>Similarly for a child click '+ child' in the section behind the 
previously assigned spouse (or family without a partner), and select the
child.
<br><u>Important:</u> Assigned partners and children have to exist in the 
dataset. It is therefore advisable to first add new persons with '+ Person'.
<br>The assignment of spouses can be changed by unchecking behind the
spouse's name, or by selecting a new spouse if the spouse field is empty.
<br>Further changes, e.g. removing of child-assignments, of persons or 
families should be made in Gramps or by editing the data file.
<br>
<h4>New persons</h4>
By clicking on '+ person' a new person is created. Everything else is like 
data changes.
<br>
<h4>Data export</h4>
Instead of sending changed data by e-mail to someone who is maintaining the
data it is also possible to store the data locally so one can independently 
build and maintain your own database.
<br>By clicking 'Export' the data of all ancestors and descendants
including siblings and partners of the selected person is  written in a new
browser window. If no person is selected, e.g. after clicking
'family names', the entire database is exported.
<br>The contents of this window must be saved to a file.
Select the window, then click Ctrl + A to select,
copy with Ctrl + C, then paste with Ctrl + V to an empty file (Notepad or Edit)
as a text file (with extension .txt).
<br>In Firefox it's easier to use the save function
(Ctrl + S). Above the 'Save' button select "text file" and specify 
a file with extension txt. 
<br>The created file can be imported into a Gramps database. But it can
also be displayed and edited with the same browser file Ahnentafel.html which
is used here.
<br>Store this browser file (using Ctrl + S) as a Web page
(HTML only) in the same folder as the exported database.
When you start the file browser (double click), the local data file must
be specified.
<br>Also this 
  <a href='javascript:open("en-help.html","help");stop()'>help file</a> 
(as Web page in en-help.html) and maybe the 
  <a href='javascript:l=navigator.language.substr(0,2);open(l+"-trans.html","trans");stop()'>
    translation file</a> 
(as ..-trans.html) should be stored locally in the same folder.
<br>Tip: If you select and export multiple people, the latest
output in the export window will be complemented by the relatives of the other person.
Thus one can export all the relatives of the person and its spouse.
<br>
<h4>Browser</h4>
This website has been tested with new Firefox and Internet Explorer versions. 
<br>With Firefox, there should be no problems.
<br>Internet Explorer basically works well. However, there are minor disadvantages,
e.g. when exporting data, save file does not 
store the data, and you are asked whether you want to enable scripts.
<br>With Chrome (Google) one can only work with data on the Internet.
This is probably also true for Safari.
